# How to write software functional and technical specifications

This document is intended to be as the template and manual for an ongoing and ever changing process to solve problems for any project, everyone can participate and collaborate to expose examples, special cases and discuss.


Well-defined problems lead to breakthrough solutions. When developing new products, processes, or even businesses, most companies aren’t sufficiently rigorous in defining the problems they’re attempting to solve and articulating why those issues are important. Without that rigor, organizations miss opportunities, waste resources, and end up pursuing innovation initiatives that aren’t aligned with their strategies. How many times have you seen a project go down one path only to realize in hindsight that it should have gone down another? How many times have you seen an innovation program deliver a seemingly breakthrough result only to find that it can’t be implemented or it addresses the wrong problem? Many organizations need to become better at asking the right questions so that they tackle the right problems.


>If I were given one hour to save the planet, I would spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute resolving it,” **Albert Einstein**.
