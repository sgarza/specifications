# The Problem-Definition Process

## Using the Problem-Definition Process

The four main steps in the Problem-Definition Process contain several smaller questions that, once answered, help you define and clarify the problem thoroughly.

The problem is the goal, not the means to the goal.

The problem are the symptom details, not what caused the symptom, not what the solutions might be.

The problem is the issue, the possibilities and the hope, not the pain of change.

The problem is the description of input and the expected output, not the algorithm.


### Establish the Need
The first step is to identify why you need a solution to the problem. To do this, answer these questions:

  * **What is the basic need?** First, write your problem down in simple terms. Then, identify the basic need that you'll fulfil once you've solved the problem.

  Examples:

  |Problem  |Need |
  |---  |---  |
  |There is no client access to the ACL rules/permissions that are already defined in the server side.|Provide a way to the client to access the rules defined in the server-side|


  * **What is the ideal outcome?** Next, identify the outcome that you want to see once you've implemented a solution.

  Don't think of any particular solutions at this point, your aim is to visualize the result of a successful solution, not the solution itself.
  It helps to be specific here: "Improve avg. server response time by 10%" is more useful than "Improve server performance."

  * **Who will (and won't) benefit?** Finally in this step, identify who will benefit, both directly and indirectly, once you've solved the problem and reached your desired outcome. Write down who these people or groups are, and the advantages that they'll see. Also consider who may be at a disadvantage if you solve the problem.


### Justify the need

> **Tip**: As you work through the next steps of this process and get more of an understanding of your problem, you may find it useful to go back and refine your answers to previous questions.

Once you understand the need for solving the problem, you must then justify why you should solve it. To do this, answer these questions:

* **Is effort aligned with the project's strategy?** This problem, and the effort that you'll be putting into solving it, must align with your project's strategic priorities, as well as its mission and values.
* **What benefits do we want, and how can we measure these?** Identify what benefits our organization, as a whole, will see when you solve this problem, and think about how you can measure these in relation to its overall strategy. Be as specific as possible.
* **Are we likely to be able to implement a solution?** Think about factors such as how you'll get support from the project's decision-makers, and how you'll access the required resources and expertise. This may involve speaking with senior managers in your organization to understand what resources may be available.


### Understand the Problem and its Wider Context

The next questions in this third step encourage you to look at the problem in more depth, and to look back into the past to see what you can learn from past efforts.

* **What's the cause?** First in this step, make sure that you have identified all of the causes of your problem.
* **What solutions already exist?** Have other people in our organization tried to solve this or a similar problem in the past? If so, what did they do? What worked and what didn't work?

  Next you need to find out if people outside of your organization have already tried to do something about this problem. Widen your search to include journals, field studies, past research, competitors, industry experts, and your personal contact network.

  Your goal is to look at what's been done already, and what hasn't worked, so that you don't waste time working on a solution that already exists, or working on a solution that's likely to fail.

* **What are the constraints?** By now, you're starting to have a deeper understanding of the problem and how it relates to our organization. Now you can brainstorm factors that might prevent you from implementing a solution.

  First, look at internal constraints. Will you have access to enough people, time, and other resources to solve this problem? Are there any rules or procedures that you must follow?

  Next, look externally. Are there any government regulations or laws that might stall or block your solutions? Is the technology available?

* **What requirements must a solution meet?** Write down the requirements that the solution must meet in order to solve the problem successfully. As part of this, also identify other factors that, while not essential for solving the problem successfully, would add value to the final solution.
* **How will we define success?** Identify how you'll define success once you've implemented a solution.


### Write a Problem Statement

The final step of **The Problem-Definition Process** is to pull together all of the information that you've gathered into a clear, comprehensive problem statement. This should provide a thorough overview of the problem, and outline a plan for how you will go about solving it.

The problem statement needs to be clear, specific, and understood by the people who should solve it. Avoid [industry jargon](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/jargon) , and make sure that it relates to its intended audience.

  **Include these points in your Problem Statement:**

* **Problem definition:** A brief description of the issues that need to be addressed by a problem solving team and should be presented to them before they try to solve the problem. This is where you establish the problem this “recipe” solves. Keep in mind that this is a **SPECIFIC SOLUTION**, meaning that it does not solve many problems, does not solve all the problems, does not build products, and **it does not solve the problem and all its possibilities**.
* **Background:** This is the summary of the previous work done on this problem: research, failed attempts or improvements done by you or someone else. Be as clear as possible because this is how you're justifying your course of action.
* **Constraints:** Is any restriction that defines a project's limitations; the scope, for example, is the limit of what the project is expected to accomplish.
* **Assumptions:** A thing that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof.
* **Requirements:** What the solution must meet in order to solve the problem successfully.
* **Research**
  * **Similar Tools**
  * **Resources**
